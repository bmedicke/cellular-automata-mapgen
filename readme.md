# cellular-automata-mapgen
Tile based map generator that works by visualizing the birth and death of cells. 
Started out as Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, but rules with fewer oscillators work better, 
because oscillations can create recognizable artifacts. Different automata create different types of maps.
